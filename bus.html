        <h2>New Modern Bus Services 2017</h2>
        <p>The NYC MTA bus transit serves all of New York City's 5 boroughs in Manhattan, Queens, Brooklyn, the Bronx, and Staten Island. 
        According to the MTA, there were 2.4 million bus riders per average weekday and 5710 buses in 2016.</p>
        
        
        <p><strong>Did You Know...</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>The city became involved with bus transit in 1919 after the organization of emergency buses to replace street car lines. Thereafter, more routes were added replacing the trolleys.</li><br/>
            <li>The NYC MTA bus transit has the world's largest fleet of buses, with about 4,373 public buses.</li> <br/>
            <li>General Motors, Orion, Nova Bus, and Motor Coach Industries are a few of the manufacturers from which the NYC MTA ordered buses.</li><br/>
            <li>The NYC MTA uses giant vacuum hoses to empty the fare boxes in the buses. For this reason, New York City buses do not accept paper money because the vacuum process would break the bills.</li><br/>
            <li>To improve the passenger experience, current New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has announced new upgrades for the next generation of buses that are coming this year 2017!</li><br/>
